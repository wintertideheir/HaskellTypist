# HaskellTypist
A variant of GNU Typist written in Haskell

## Objectives
Haskell Typist has the same objectives as GNU Typist - to improve typing ability by lessons, drills, and tests.
The differences are a greater variance in practice types, flexibility in input, and practical application.
More options are presented in interpreting arbitrary input, judging performance, and presenting problems.
Key strokes are recorded and analyzed and performance is tracked across time.
A unique ability of Haskell Typist is to use play, couple, and understand audio.
